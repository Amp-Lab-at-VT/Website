# Overview

The Bambu Labs P1P is a core-xy 3D printer, developed by former DJI engineers. What you need to know:

- It's stupid fast, twice as fast as traditional bedslingers (Ender 3's, Prusa MK3, etc)
- It is cloud-enabled. While you can print with the SD card, you can also log into the associated account and print remotely
- The build volume is 250x250x250 (As seen in the build plate)
