### Basic Soldering Training
Basic soldering training training program builds upon the foundation of general soldering techniques and focuses on practical skills for soldering a functional PCB. You have the option to select one of the following PCB projects for this training:

- B-BOP: Bipolar Breadboard Power Supply (Recommended)
- Boost Converter Business Card (Parts Out of Stock)

Upon successfully completing the training, you'll not only gain invaluable soldering skills but also get to keep the PCB board you've assembled during the training!

This training will not cover advanced soldering techniques (techniques for building circuits such as microcontroller board, PCâ€™s, etc). It is highly recomended you sign up for advanced soldering after completion of general training.

Schedule a meeting with one of our mentors for basic training using the following form (Please note that general training must be completed before starting advanced soldering training.)
