## Soldering Training
The AMP Lab provides three levels of soldering training for students:
<a class="btn" href="/soldering/basic">Basic Soldering Training</a>
<a class="btn" href="/soldering/intermediate">Intermediate Soldering Training</a>
<a class="btn" href="/soldering/advanced">Advanced Soldering Training</a> 

Completion of basic or higher soldering training allows the use of soldering equipment, unsupervised, in the AMP Lab. Anyone caught using soldering equipment without the basic or higher training will be denied access to the AMP Lab for at least one semester.

Note: If you have completed general training in the past then you are basic certified and can directly move on to the intermediate training. If you have completed basic training before Fall 2023 you are intermediate   certified and can move on to advance soldering training.
