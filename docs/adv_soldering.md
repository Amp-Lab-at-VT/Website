# **Advanced Soldering Training**

Welcome to the realm of Advanced Soldering Training at the AMP Lab. If you're seeking to elevate your soldering skills and master intricate surface-mount soldering techniques, you're in the right place. There is an exceptional facility tailored at the lab to help you conquer the world of surface-mount soldering with finesse.

Upon successfully completing the training, you'll have mastered the ability to solder surface mount devices and utilize equipment like stencil printer, reflow oven, etc.

Those who complete the advanced surface-mount certification will be strongly encouraged to mentor others who wish to learn surface-mount prototype soldering.

**Objective:** \
Upon completing the Advanced Soldering Training, you'll confidently master soldering the following surface mount components:

- SOIC-8, 1.27 mm pitch

- TSSOP-8, 0.65 mm pitch

- VSSOP-8, 0.5 mm pitch

- SOT-23-5, 0.95 mm pitch

- QFP-44-10x10, 0.8 mm pitch

- QFP-100-12x12, 0.4 mm pitch

- QFN-20-5x5, 0.65 mm pitch

- QFN-20-4x4, 0.5 mm pitch

- QFN-20-3x3, 0.4 mm pitch

- 1206 resistors (3216 metric) 3.2 x 1.6 mm

- 0805 resistors (2012 metric) 2.0 x 1.25 mm

- 0603 resistors (1608 metric) 1.6 x 0.8 mm

- 0402 resistors (1005 metric) 1.0 x 0.5 mm

**Prerequisite:** \
Intermediate Solder Training at The AMP Lab

**Estimated Time:** \
4-6 Weeks

**Practice Board:** \
Do Nothing Board 2

**Certification Board Available:** \
->The AMP Lab Microcontroller \
&emsp; ->[Manual TBD](https://amp-lab.org/404) \
&emsp; ->[Board Files TBD](https://amp-lab.org/404)


**Procedure:** \
    ->The instructor will meet with you once a week. \
    ->You will then practice on your own what the instructor went over that week. \
    ->You will first hand solder as much of the practice board possible. \
    ->You will then use the reflow oven to solder the practice board. \
    ->Once the instructor is satisfied with your progress they will hand you the certfiction board of your choice.\
    ->Solder the certfiction board. Be sure to check it manual above.
