# Creating Documentation

Creating documentation is easy! There is a folder called "docs/general_documentation" in the repository. Inside this folder, you can create a new markdown file with the name of the documentation you want to create. For example, if you want to create a documentation called "Adding New Documentation", you can create a file called "Adding New Documentation.md". The file will be automatically pulled into the documentation page of the website, and you can access it by going to the "Documentation" page on the website.

It's as easy as that! Subfolders are currently not supported, so please keep all documentation in the "docs/general_documentation" folder.

# How to write in Markdown format

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
