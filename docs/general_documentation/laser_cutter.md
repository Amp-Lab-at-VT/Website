# Laser Cutter Instructions

## Installing Software

First, download the [UCP Driver](https://www.ulsinc.com/support/software-downloads). Go to the top drop-down box labelled "Download Drivers for VLS, PLS and ILS Platforms", then select "UCP Installer (Windows 10/11)". Download and install the software.

Next, download [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). There are a few drawing programs that are compatible with the laser cutter, but I recommend using Inkscape because it's free and easy to use.

If you're running Windows 11, you'll need to [revert to the old print dialog](https://wiki.autocountsoft.com/wiki/Others:_How_to_switch_back_to_the_old_print_dialog_in_Windows_11%3F) for the UCP driver to work properly. This is because the UCP driver shows the laser cutter as a printer in the windows print dialog, but the new print dialog is unable to properly render vector cuts/engrave lines.

## Using Inkscape

TODO

Laser cutters are governed by the following `equation`:
$$f=ma$$

```python
print('hello')
```
