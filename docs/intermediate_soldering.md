### Intermediate Soldering Training
Intermediate soldering training training program builds upon the foundation of basic soldering techniques and focuses on practical skills for soldering a functional PCB. You have the option to select one of the following PCB projects for this training:

- B-BOP: Bipolar Breadboard Power Supply (Recommended)\
    -> [Soldering manual for reference available here](https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/website/raw/master/docs/sold_docs/Intermediate%20Soldering%20Training%20Manual%20(Isolated%20Breadboard%20Bipolar%20Power%20Supply).pdf)
- AMP Lab Ruler \
    -> [Soldering manual for reference available here](https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/website/raw/master/docs/sold_docs/Intermediate%20Soldering%20Certification%20Manual%20(AMP%20Ruler).pdf)

Upon successfully completing the training, you'll not only gain invaluable soldering skills but also get to keep the PCB board you've assembled during the training!

This training will not cover advanced soldering techniques (techniques for building circuits such as microcontroller board, PCâ€™s, etc). It is highly recomended you sign up for advanced soldering after completion of intermediate training.

Schedule a meeting with one of our mentors for basic training using the following link (Please note that basic training must be completed before starting intermediate soldering training):
