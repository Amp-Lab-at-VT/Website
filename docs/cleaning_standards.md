# Amp Lab Cleaning Standards

# Overview:

"Everything has a place. If you don't know, just ask. If no leadership is around, reach out on Discord or refer to this page for general reference"

" 


## For Personal Spaces

- "We do not have official personal spaces in the lab"
- You should always leave the spaces how you found them 
- If you need a space for an extended period of time, please reach out to Amp Lab staff to coordinate
- Tables should be left clean and free of project materials. If you require a bin, please do the following:

        - Find the organization station, and grab yourself a label
        - Find a bin that is roughly the size need for your project, and place all project materials in the bin. If there is no bin, reach out to the Amp Lab leadership team through Discord
        - Place the bin on the back project wall

- Parts and tool on the Amp Lab side are specifically for Amp Lab members. MDE students that need parts need to request it from Amp Lab staff
- The Amp Lab and MDE sides are designated, specific areas divided by an iron curtain (the yellow line). This is to enforce cleanliness and accountability to both co-curricular activities.

# FAQ

Why the heck do we have to keep things clean? It's my project and my space
        News flash: no it's not. This is a shared lab space. If you leave a table in a wreck, then other students won't have the ability to work.
