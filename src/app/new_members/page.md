This process is now simpler than ever! Follow the steps below to get started

* Fork this repo. Remember to rename it and such!
  * [Sample Project](https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/SampleProject/fork)

* Clone the repo locally, edit the files, and push it to Github. If you are unsure about a section, skip it and your mentor will discuss it with you when it comes time! At the very least, please include a project description

* Include the link to the forked repo in this form:
  * [Join the Amp Lab: Submit your project for review!](https://github.com/Amp-Lab-at-VT/website/issues/new/choose)

* Wait for AMP lab staff to reach out to you about your project!

**Too confusing?** We get it, git isn't an easy thing to master. Check [this tutorial](/beginners_guide) to get started without having to clone the repo locally.
