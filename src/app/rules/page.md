# Rules

> ```Below are the common rules and expectations of the lab. We enjoy giving students autonomy, but to foster a better lab environment there rules are in place for all students```

- No food or drink in the lab
- No propping the door open
- Desks are shared: keep them clean in between work sessions
- Guests are allowed in the lab, under supervision of an Amp Lab student
- Amp Lab and MDE sides are **seperate**. Please keep all parts, projects, tools seperate and isolated to their respective sides
- Completion of basic or higher soldering training is required to make use of soldering equipment, unsupervised
- All CAM tools (3D printer, CNC, Laser Cutter) can be used and operated by mentors **only**. If you need something made, this will go in as a service request. Note the "get something printed" button on the "Getting Started" page

> If you enjoy working as an AMP lab member, consider giving back to the lab by working as a soldering instructor, helping clean the lab, or reaching out to the leadership team to see what they need! You can reach us on Discord, which you will find a link to on the "Getting Started" page
